<h2>Game of Thrones</h2>
<h3>Dragons! </h3>
<p>
Even those who don’t watch “Game of Thrones” probably know that it features dragons.

They start out small and adorable — they cook their own food with their fiery breath! — And later become the terrifying instruments of Dany’s (Emilia Clarke) liberation force.

Either way, they’re amazing. And you’ll probably find yourself wishing that they were real and that you owned one.</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Stellar performances.</h3>
<p>
It’d be easy for “Game of Thrones” to become high camp. The show is set in a fictional world populated with dragons and witches and littered with made-up languages.

But nearly every performance on the show is pitch perfect and filled with true emotion. Despite the potentially silly fantasy trappings, “Game of Thrones” is always seriously great.

Case in point: star Emilia Clarke received an Emmy nomination in 2013 for an episode where most of her lines were in a made-up language.

Acting!
<p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>A fully-realized world. </h3>
<p>
“Game of Thrones” features a massive world, not unlike Tolkien’s Middle Earth.

The show has only explored two of its four continents — Westeros and Essos — but both are realized in breathtaking detail by the show’s masterful production design team.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Magic.</h3>
<p>
Besides the aforementioned dragons, “Game of Thrones” also features priestesses, giant wolves, “Walking Dead”-like zombies, and magical green fire.

The show overfloweth with enchantment.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<h3>Surprises.</h3>
<p>
Some are bigger than others, but nearly every episode of “Game of Thrones” features something that’ll make you do a double take.

Expect the unexpected, but also expect the stuff you wouldn’t expect in your wildest dreams.<br/><br/>

So hop on this faux-medieval bandwagon before it’s too late.

Season four of “Game of Thrones” premieres April 6 at 9/8C on HBO. Previous seasons are available on DVD, Blu-Ray, HBOGo, iTunes, Amazon and On Demand.

<h2> The Arrow </h2>
<h3>OLIVER QUEEN</h3>
<p>
Oliver Queen (played by Stephen Amell) is one of the most complex and mysterious characters on TV right now.
He grew up a self-entitled rich kid who never had any real responsibilities.
That was all before the accident.
After being marooned on a deserted island for five years, Queen becomes a new man;
a man who had to fight to stay alive, and a man who's now trying to figure out what's worth living for.
He's just one of the reasons to watch Arrow.
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<h3>THE FLASHBACKS</h3>
<p>
Throughout the present-day story lines, flashbacks are incorporated in every episode.
Each flashback gives the audience a glimpse at Oliver's #time on the island.
I love the fact that the past and present are intertwined because I like being able to connect the dots in every episode.
You find out why Oliver Queen is the way that he is, and what it took him to survive.
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<h3>PLOT TWISTS </h3>
<p>
Okay, I might spill some SPOILERS for this one.
So, please #read at your own risks!
It seems like Arrow gets crazier with each episode.
I mean, I did NOT see the whole "Sara is alive" thing coming.
Did you?
Also, Slade is alive and plotting revenge on Oliver?
Where did he even come from?
The plot thickens with each crazy twist but I can't help but love it all.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>FELICITY SMOAK </h3>
<p>
Felicity has become one of my favorite characters.
She's such a humble, personable #girl.
She's a smokin' hot IT babe whose witty dialogue keeps everyone laughing.
She's quirky and awkward, which is so fun to watch.
Also, there's this whole "will they or won't they" thing she has going on with Oliver.
I'm not quite sure which side I'm rooting for yet!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>COMIC REFERENCES</h3>
<p>
Arrow stays true to it's comic-origin and utilizes the vast network of characters and arcs.
The show has incorporated many characters from the DC Universe into its structure and fans are thrilled about it.
The show has brought in heroes and villains like Red Arrow, Deadshot, Deathstroke, and A.R.G.U.S, just to name a few.
Well, there you have it!
These are just seven out of many reasons why you should be watching Arrow.
Trust me, it'll be hard to figure out why it took you so long to start in the first place.

<h2>The Flash</h2>
<h3>The Flash Will Brighten Your Day</h3>
<p>
We all have bad days. It’s bound to happen sooner or later. Some days we’re just going to be down in the dumps. 
But when The Flash is on, and Barry Allen and his friends are discovering new things about the speed force, there is no sadness. 
Sure there are some sad moments in the show sprinkled in, as all good drama involves some emotions, but the heart of the show captures a sense of wonder not found in most superhero adaptations. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>A DC Property NOT Trying to be Dark or Edgy</h3>
<p>
Thank whatever God you pray to because we have a DC adaptation not interested in following a “serious” aesthetic (by serious, I mean Hot Topic level of mature and serious). 
The Flash has more in common with Raimi Spider-Man trilogy than the Nolanized aesthetic of Arrow.
This show isn’t interested in making things as “real” as possible, or aping some depressing tone.
These are fictional adventure serials with a time traveling supervillain from the future and a giant gorilla living underground. 
It’s ridiculous and fully embracing an appropriate tone for this sort of storytelling.
</p>
</li> 
<li> 
<h3>Cast Chemistry</h3>
<p>
Not only does Flash actually make every character feel relevant to the story at hand, something that even Game of Thrones struggles with, and you don’t want to stop spending time with these characters.
 By the end of the first episode of The Flash, the season’s status quo is set and we have our Team Flash for the remainder of the season, until some upending of the status proving it is not quo.
 By the jaw dropping finale the team feels less like coworkers and more like family.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>A Diverse Cast</h3>
<p>The superhero genre is currently flooded with lots of white male men leading the charge. DC and Marvel both have this problem. 
Flash is no different. HOWEVER, Flash has a fully realized cast of characters of all races and genders. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>It’s Just a Damn Good Show</h3>
<p>
Seriously, thank you The Flash, for proving you don’t need an attempt at “darker” and “edgier” storytelling to garner attention. 
You don’t need a dozen plot twists or cliffhangers to keep your audience hooked (though Flash absolutely contains all those elements. 
It’s not what a show is about, it’s how it’s about it. And The Flash is about one of the best shows on television.

<h2> Suits </h2>
<h3> Reality and Suits have never met</h3>
<p>
If you're trying to escape reality, you're in the right place. he chat's from the school of Aaron Sorkin (which isn't surprising - the show's creator Aaron Korsh is a huge fan).
 90 per cent of scenes (give or take) end in either an ultimatum - cue swell of dramatic music. It's pretty much Game of Thrones in Tom Ford suits.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Harvey Specter is a new age philosopher</h3>
<p>
The quotable heart of it all is Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), with his spectacular expanse of forehead. 
His Specterisms are a handbook of platitudes for life in a dog-eat-dog world. "Sometimes the good guy's got to do bad things to make the bad guys pay".
Suits props up the fantasy that if you "get your shit together", "have goals instead of dreams" and "break the god damn wall down" when your back's up against it, you can be Harvey Specter too. 

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>The smartest guy in the room is the one who made the worst life choices</h3>
<p>
The other half of Suits' much-loved bromance, Mike Ross, gives hope to university drop-outs everywhere.
 He manages to make it to partner status in a top law firm (and through 4.5 seasons) without being properly called to task on the major fraud he's pedalling - he never passed the bar, nor did he go to Harvard.
Mike's the underdog; just a normal guy trying to get by. "Just like me!" you can tell yourself, as you ignore the fact that Mike has an eidetic memory, and is therefore basically superman.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>It's dripping in pop-culture nostalgia</h3>
<p>
Just like you, these characters communicate in endless references to their favourite TV shows. U
se them to compile a must-rewatch list and block out your evenings for the next few months. Harvey justifies his daytime drinking with a shout-out to Mad Men and
Louis (office villain-cum-fool), who "always pays his debts", calls himself a Lannister.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>This show was made for drinking</h3>
<p>
Is Suits formulaic? Well, sure. But if you're worrying about that, then you're missing the point. And the point is, drinking games.
Have a Google and take your pick, but the simplest and the best is the one we've just christened "Shot per Shit".

<h2> Silicon Valley </h2>
<h3>The tech satire</h3>
<p>
If the tech world has ever sounded like a mish mash of unnecessary verbiage and complete manipulation of what words actually mean, 
then you’ll appreciate Silicon Valley’s satire of the information industry.
 They mock that world’s double-speak and inflated sense of importance. In a world that’s great at writing code, but not great at using language, 
 the best thing about Silicon Valley’s writing is that the mockery is clear even when you don’t know what a VC is.
 Then there’s the swipes at pointless tech, like Dinesh’s cousin who’s raising money for an app called “Bro.”
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<h3>“Billionaires are people, too.”</h3>
<p>
The only thing better than Silicon Valley’s satire of the tech industry itself is its skewering of the cluelessly super rich—and there’s certainly no shortage of them here. 
Pied Piper’s primary nemesis, Hooli CEO Gavin Belson (Matt Ross), talks out both sides of his mouth claiming to value forgiveness even as he sues Pied Piper. 
He has a spiritual advisor paid to tell him he’s doing everything right and later compares the plight of billionaires to the persecution of the Jewish people in Nazi Germany.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They’re endearing bros</h3>
<p>
The Pied Piper guys, though, are endearing nerds even as they play at being assholes. 
They’re each other’s only real friends, hate going to parties and interacting with other people, but they still never stop faux insulting each other.
 Most heartening, though, is watching Richard actually win when he gets frustrated enough to stick up for himself.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They’re adding women characters</h3>
<p>When the show’s very first trailer was released (and later when it actually aired), 
it was criticized for the lack of female engineers. Monica (Amanda Crew), the assistant to Pied Piper’s original funder Peter Gregory, 
was the only woman on the show as a regular character, and she generally played the sane, reasonable straight man.
 But this season has seen the addition of Suzanne Cryer as Laurie Bream, who was brought in as Peter Gregory’s replacement at Raviga Capital. 
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<h3>Zach Woods as Donald “Jared” Dunn</h3>
<p>
Woods plays Jared Dunn, the head of business development for Pied Piper, and in many ways, resident den mother.
 Jared is always looking out for Richard’s well-being (“How are you feeling? Do you need protein?”), 
and most of the time, he’s the character that’s just excited to have a crew of guys to be his buddies, 
whether or not they actually act like they appreciate him. 
</p>
